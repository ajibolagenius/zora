**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a visually polished React Native/Expo app with a dark theme. It features a complete onboarding flow and a main tab interface (Home, Explore, Orders, Cart, Profile).

A major refactor has been completed to unify the data source. All primary screens (Home, Explore, Product Details, Vendor Storefront) now fetch data exclusively from a new  which reads from , replacing previous disparate mock data and external API calls.

A centralized design system is in place and being rolled out across the app:
- **Colors, Spacing, Typography:** Defined in .
- **Fonts:**  and  have been installed via  and are loaded in the root layout. The typography system has been updated to use them.
- **Component Styles:** A new  file was created to enforce consistency, which is currently being applied codebase-wide.

Multiple screens and components have been redesigned to match user UI references and updated to use the new fonts and data schema.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent was performing a large-scale refactor to apply the new centralized styling system and fonts (/) to the *entire* codebase, as requested by the user. The agent had just started this task by overwriting the four onboarding and auth screens (, , , and ) with updated styles.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? screenshot tool
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1: Test the refactored onboarding and login screens (P0)

  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - Attempted fixes: No fixes attempted. The agent just overwrote the files.
     - Next debug checklist: 
        1. Restart the expo service: expo: ERROR (not running)
expo: started.
        2. Use the  to navigate to the login screen () and proceed through the onboarding flow (, , ).
        3. Verify that all screens render correctly without crashes and that the  and  fonts are applied correctly to titles and body text.
        4. If there are crashes or visual bugs, inspect the recently modified files for styling errors or incorrect logic.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? This is the first step of a major refactor. Verifying it works is critical before proceeding with the rest of the codebase.
     - Status:  NOT STARTED
     - Is recurring issue? N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend
     - Blocked on other issue: None

**In progress Task List**:
  - Task 1:  Complete codebase-wide refactor to use centralized styles and fonts (P0)

 Task Detail:
  - Task 1: 
     - Where to resume: The onboarding/auth screens have been updated. The next step is to continue this refactor for all remaining UI components () and any other screens that haven't been updated yet. A systematic check of all  files in  is required.
     - What will be achieved with this? The entire application will have a consistent look and feel, adhering to the defined design system and typography, making future UI changes much easier to manage.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend
     - Blocked on something: Needs verification of the already-completed part (Pending Issue 1).

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React Native, Expo, Expo Router, TypeScript
- **Styling:** Centralized  system.  is still present but being phased out in favor of the new system.
- **Fonts:**  used to load 'Montserrat' and 'Inter' fonts application-wide.
- **Data Fetching:** A unified  that synchronously reads from a local  file. This has replaced all previous Axios/API calls.
- **State Management:** Zustand.

**key DB schema**
N/A. All data is sourced from . The schema can be inferred by inspecting this file.

**changes in tech stack**
- **Data Source:** Migrated from a mix of a mock FastAPI backend and external REST APIs to a single, unified  file accessed via a new frontend service.
- **Styling:** Moving towards a centralized -based design system (, , etc.) and away from ad-hoc styling or NativeWind.
- **Fonts:** Added  to manage and load custom fonts.

**All files of reference**
- **Recently Modified/In-Progress:**
  -  (Overwritten, needs testing)
  -  (Overwritten, needs testing)
  -  (Overwritten, needs testing)
  -  (Overwritten, needs testing)
- **Key New/Updated Files:**
  -  (The new data source)
  -  (The new data service)
  -  (Updated with font families)
  -  (New file for centralized styles)
  -  (Updated to load fonts)

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The entire codebase is currently undergoing a refactor to adopt the centralized style system. This task is in-progress and must be completed.

**key api endpoints**
N/A. The app no longer uses API endpoints and relies solely on .

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Your IMMEDIATE task is to continue a major refactor.** The goal is to apply the centralized design system (fonts and styles from ) to every component and screen in the app.
- **Start by testing the work already done.** The previous agent updated four onboarding/auth screens but did not test them. You must verify these screens work before continuing the refactor.
- **The data source is now .** All data fetching should go through . Do not use  or the backend server.
- **Use the defined fonts:**  for headings and  for body text, as defined in .

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken:** The onboarding and login screens are in an untested state after being overwritten with new styles. They may be broken.
- **Mocked:** The entire data layer is mocked via a local JSON file. The FastAPI backend is present but unused.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- **@expo-google-fonts/montserrat:** Used for heading fonts.
- **@expo-google-fonts/inter:** Used for body fonts.
- **Phosphor Icons:** Used for all iconography.
- **NativeWind:** Present in the project but being actively phased out.
- **Stripe React Native SDK:** Installed, but not integrated.

**Testing status**
  - Testing agent used after significant changes: NO (The last major refactor has not been tested).
  - Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop: NO
  - Test files created: []
  - Known regressions: None known, but the app is in a fragile state due to the ongoing refactor.

**Credentials to test flow:**
N/A (Authentication is not implemented).

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent was in the middle of a large-scale, systematic refactoring task. It did not forget anything, but it stopped after completing the first batch of file updates. The immediate next action is to **test** those updates and then **continue** the refactor on the remaining files.
